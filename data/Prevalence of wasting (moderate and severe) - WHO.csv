"5","Regional averages for underweight (moderate and severe), stunting (moderate and severe), wasting (moderate and severe) and overweight (including obesity) are estimated using statistical modeling of data from the UNICEF and WHO Joint Global Nutrition Database, 2011 revision (completed July 2012).  The severe underweight indicator was not included in this exercise; regional averages for this indicator are based on a population-weighted average calculated by UNICEF. Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified in the column heading. Due to the cession in July 2011 of the Republic of South Sudan by the Republic of the Sudan, and its subsequent admission to the UN on 14 July 2011, disaggregated data for Sudan and South Sudan as separate States are not yet available for all indicators. In these cases, aggregated data are presented for Sudan pre-cession (see Memorandum item)."
